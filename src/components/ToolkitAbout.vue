      This toolkit has been designed by members of the “Reimagining research practices: towards a
      sustainable, ethical and inclusive future” project team at Lancaster University, which brought
      together various departments and services within Lancaster University, including LICA, the
      Library, LEC, Psychology, and Research Services. Research staff who have previous experience
      in undertaking citizen science and community participatory research were interviewed to
      provide case studies and input into the content. The Reimagining Research Practices project
      was funded from 2024 to 2026 by the Wellcome Trust.
